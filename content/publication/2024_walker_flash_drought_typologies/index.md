abstract: Flash droughts, characterized by rapid onset and intensification, are increasingly occurring as a consequence of climate change and rising temperatures. However, existing hydrometeorological definitions fail to encompass the full range of flash droughts, many of which have distinct local physical attributes. Consequently, these events often go undetected or unforecast in generic global flash drought assessments and are underrepresented in research. To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive survey to gather information on local nomenclature, characteristics, and impacts of flash droughts worldwide. The survey revealed the widespread occurrence of these phenomena, highlighting their underresearched nature. By analyzing case studies, through literature review often in local languages to unearth elusive studies, we identified five different types of flash droughts based on their specific characteristics. Our study aims to increase awareness about the complexity and diverse impacts of flash droughts, emphasizing the importance of considering regional contexts and the vulnerability of affected populations. The reported impacts underscore the need for better integration of all flash drought types in drought research, monitoring, and management. Monitoring a combination of indicators is crucial for timely detection and response to this emerging and escalating threat.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This study aims to better understand flash droughts worldwide and their varying characteristics and impacts. We surveyed the experiences of people affected by flash droughts and then examined a wide range of literature, including non-English and nonacademic sources. This helped us understand how flash droughts can differ from those commonly studied in the United States and China. We identified and described five types of flash droughts, some of which may not be detected by current drought measurement methods. It is crucial to include all types of flash droughts in drought monitoring systems and management plans, as they are expected to become more common due to global warming. We can then better prepare for and reduce the impacts of this growing threat.
