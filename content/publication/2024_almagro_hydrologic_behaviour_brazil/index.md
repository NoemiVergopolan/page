abstract: Despite hosting ∼16% of the global freshwater and almost 50% of water resources in South America, Brazilian catchment-scale relationships between drivers and streamflow are still poorly understood. Here, we used streamflow signatures and attributes of 735 catchments from the Catchment Attributes for Brazil data set to investigate the dominant hydrological processes for the catchments. We also assess how catchments group based on hydrologic behavior similarities and analyze which climatic/landscape attributes control the streamflow variability. To classify and group the catchments, we used the k-means method optimized by the Elbow approach, along with a Principal Component Analysis. Uncertainty on catchment grouping was checked by k-fold cross-validation. Then, we used a recursive feature elimination using the random forest technique to assess the most influential catchment attributes to the hydrological signatures. Our results revealed six similarity groups, which followed mainly an aridity gradient ranging from the wettest to the driest, but also seasonality. The climate is the primary driver of hydrological behavior for the water-limited groups, highlighting the influence and importance of the atmospheric demand in several Brazilian catchments. High soil storage capacity in energy-limited catchments associated with high precipitation led to high discharge all year due to the subsurface fluxes' contribution. Our findings may be useful to improve streamflow predictability and hydrological behavior identification by further understanding hydrological similarities and their signatures due to catchment landscape characteristics. Further, by employing an easily reproducible methodology and clear metrics to weigh uncertainty, our study provides a significant step toward establishing a catchment-scale common classification system.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract
summary: Brazil holds 16% of the world’s freshwater, yet its water systems are still not fully understood. To understand how rainfall and rivers interact across the country, we studied the hydrologic signatures of 735 catchments. Through catchment classification we identified six major water behavior groups, mostly based on how wet or dry the regions are. In drier areas, climate drives streamflow; in wetter ones, soil and land features matter more. This helps map and predict when and where floods or droughts are likely to happen and it also guides smarter water storage and usage in vulnerable regions. Ultimately, this research supports better planning for a changing climate.

  caption: "This figure shows six groups of Brazilian catchments with similar water behavior. Panel (a) maps their locations across the country’s major biomes. Panels (b) and (c) show how each group differs in terms of dryness (aridity index, Φ) and rainfall seasonality (δ*p), revealing key climate patterns that shape river flow across Brazil."
