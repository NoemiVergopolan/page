I am a computational hydrologist with a PhD in Civil and Environmental Engineering from Princeton University. My research aims to aid water resource decision-making by improving monitoring and forecasting of hydrological hazards and their impacts at the local scales. To this aim, I work developing scalable solutions for high-resolution hydrological predictions by leveraging satellite remote sensing, land surface modeling, machine learning, data fusion, and high-performance computing. Learn more about my research interests in [research](#projects) and [publications](publication).
