I am a computational hydrologist, engineer, and scientist working on solutions for water resources and climate. My research aims to aid actionable decision-making by improving hydrological information for monitoring and forecasting of hydrological extremes and their impacts. To this end, I develop scalable computational approaches for high-resolution hydrological prediction by leveraging satellite remote sensing, land surface modeling, machine learning, data fusion, and high-performance computing. My research targets local to global applications on freshwater resources, agriculture, floods and droughts, and land-atmosphere interactions.

### Background
Currently, I am a postdoctoral research associate in the [Atmospheric and Ocean Science Program](https://aos.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University and the [NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/) working with Dr. Elena Shevliakova on Earth System Modeling and satellite land data assimilation. In 2021, I obtained a PhD in Civil and Environmental Engineering from Princeton University, working with Prof. Eric Wood and Justin Sheffield. Before Princeton, I worked on water resources and environmental engineering consulting.
