I am a computational hydrologist, engineer, and scientist working on solutions for water resources and climate. My research aims to aid actionable decision-making by improving hydrological information for monitoring and forecasting hydrological extremes and their impacts at the local scales. To this end, I develop scalable computational approaches for high-resolution hydrological prediction by leveraging advances in satellite remote sensing, land surface modeling, machine learning, data fusion, and high-performance computing. 

Currently, I am working on satellite land data assimilation for Earth System Models as a researcher in the [Atmospheric and Ocean Science Program](https://aos.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University and visiting research scientist at the [NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/). Prior, I worked on water resources and environmental engineering consulting. I hold a M.A. and Ph.D. in Civil and Environmental Engineering from Princeton University.

For my contribution to science, I was awarded the 2022 AGU Science for Solutions Award for *"outstanding contributions to water and food security through advances in hyper-resolution land surface modeling and satellite remote sensing"* and the 2022 Paul F. Boulos Excellence in Computational Hydrology Award by the American Academy of Environmental Engineers and Scientists.

**News**: Starting in July 2024, I will join [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/) as an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Earth, Environment, and Planetary Sciences](https://eeps.rice.edu/). Prospective PhD students and postdocs keen on contributing to the fields of computational hydrology and remote sensing are encouraged to [reach out](#contact).
