I am a computational hydrologist, engineer, and scientist working on solutions for water resources and climate. My research aims to aid actionable decision-making by improving hydrological information for monitoring and forecasting hydrological extremes and their impacts at the local scales. To this end, I develop scalable computational approaches for high-resolution hydrological prediction by leveraging advances in satellite remote sensing, land surface modeling, machine learning, data fusion, and high-performance computing. 

I hold a PhD in Civil and Environmental Engineering from Princeton University, working with Prof. Eric Wood and Justin Sheffield. Currently, I am a postdoctoral research associate in the [Atmospheric and Ocean Science Program](https://aos.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University and the [NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/) working with Dr. Elena Shevliakova on Earth System Modeling and land satellite data assimilation. Prior, I worked on water resources and environmental engineering consulting. 

For my contribution to science, I was awarded the 2022 Paul F. Boulos Excellence in Computational Hydrology Award by the American Academy of Environmental Engineers and Scientists and the 2022 AGU Science for Solutions Award for *"outstanding contributions to water and food security through advances in hyper-resolution land surface modeling and satellite remote sensing"*.
